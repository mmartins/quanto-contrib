Hi,

In an application with no tasks
I modified the TinyOS scheduler for Quanto, by adding a separate, low priority task queue.
This task queue has a position for each task that is declared of type TaskQuanto.
Specifically, in tinyos-2.x-contrib/berkeley/quanto/tos/lib/quanto/SingleContext/SingleContextSchedulerQuantoTasksP.nc:


  enum
  {
   ...
    NUM_TASKS_Q = uniqueCount("TinySchedulerC.TaskQuanto"),
   ...
  };

  ...

  volatile uint8_t m_q_next[NUM_TASKS_Q];
  volatile act_t m_q_act[NUM_TASKS_Q]; //Quanto: activity of each task

  ...

All is fine and good, except when I am using this scheduler and there are no such tasks declared.
Then the above declarations become respectively uint8_t m_q_next[0] and uint16_t m_q_act[0], which causes msp430-gcc to complain with the nasty

app.c:(.text+0x145c): warning: internal error: unsupported relocation error
