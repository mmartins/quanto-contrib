SingleActivityResource is the interface to be used for resources that can only
be set to a single activity at any given time. The foremost example of this is
one (single-core) CPU. Contrast with MultiActivityResource interface.

Each single-owner resource in the system should be represented by a
SingleActivityResource.

The interfaces are implemented as a compact array, as wired via the
SingleActivityResourceC generic component. Each wiring id MUST be created with
the NEW_QUANTO_RESOURCE_ID macro.  Earlier versions of Quanto used a keymap to
map global resource ids to internal compact ids, but we changed that for
efficiency reasons as the mapping required a set of case statements in the
generated code for the translation. This is important for quanto as it is
called on every interrupt.
