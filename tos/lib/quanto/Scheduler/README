Scheduler
---------
The scheduler for quanto is QuantoSchedulerLpTasksP, as wired in
TinySchedulerC.nc.

This scheduler correctly propagates activity labels as tasks get
scheduled.  It also adds a lowest-priority TaskQuanto queue, that runs
Quanto logging tasks at the lowest priority.  TaskQuanto tasks are
used by the Low-priority serial stack for streaming quanto logging.

The scheduler also allows scheduling TaskQuanto to run under an
activity that is not the current activity when they get scheduled,
without causing extra activity-switches to do that.
